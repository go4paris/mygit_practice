Auditing in Oracle
===================

Auditing is the monitoring and recording of selected user database actions. 
In standard auditing, you use initialization parameters and the AUDIT and NOAUDIT SQL statements 
to audit SQL statements, privileges, and schema objects, and network and multitier activities.

Oracle stores information that is relevant to auditing in its data dictionary.

Every time a user attempts anything in the database where audit is enabled the Oracle kernel checks 
to see if an audit record should be created or updated (in the case or a session record) and 
generates the record in a table owned by the SYS user called AUD$. This table is, by default, 
located in the SYSTEM tablespace. This itself can cause problems with potential denial of service attacks. 
If the SYSTEM tablespace fills up, the database will hang.

Auditing is disabled by default, but can enabled by setting the AUDIT_TRAIL static parameter, 
which has the following allowed values.

AUDIT_TRAIL = { none | os | db | db,extended | xml | xml,extended }

The following list provides a description of each setting:

    none or false - Auditing is disabled.
    db or true - Auditing is enabled, with all audit records stored in the database audit trial (SYS.AUD$).
    db,extended - As db, but the SQL_BIND and SQL_TEXT columns are also populated.
    xml- Auditing is enabled, with all audit records stored as XML format OS files.
    xml,extended - As xml, but the SQL_BIND and SQL_TEXT columns are also populated.
    os- Auditing is enabled, with all audit records directed to the operating system's audit trail.


To enable auditing and direct audit records to the database audit trail, we would do the following.


1.  Log in as SYS with SYSDBA privileges

Sqlplus / as sysdba

2.  Check the current settings

SQL> show parameter audit
NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
---------------------- ----------- ------------------------------
audit_file_dest        string      /opt/app/oracle/admin/db11/adump
audit_sys_operations   boolean     FALSE
audit_syslog_level     string
audit_trail            string      DB

3.  Set the type of auditing you want by setting the audit_trail parameter

SQL> alter system set audit_trail=OS scope=spfile;
System altered.

4.  Set the auditing destination

SQL> alter system set audit_file_dest='/opt/app/oracle/admin/db11/adump' scope=spfile;
System altered.

5.  Restart the Oracle instance

SQL> SHUTDOWN
SQL> STARTUP



Also note that there are two additional parameters audit_sys_operations and audit_syslog_level 
that you should consider setting if you are concerned about the SYS account activity.

1.audit_sys_operations - this initialization parameter tells Oracle to turn on auditing of the SYS connections, 
and users connecting with the SYSDBA or SYSOPER privilege. It has either a TRUE or FALSE value

2.audit_syslog_level – this initialization parameter enables SYS and 
standard OS auditing records to be written to the system using the SYSLOG utility
